 In this paper, we consider the problem of aligning uplink and downlink
 handover areas in UMTS networks.
 Our optimization approach, based on simulated annealing, gives good solutions
 to the problem without any parameter tuning.
 We report the results of our experiments for three UMTS networks of different
 sizes based on a real network currently deployed in Slovenia.

Problem description
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In mobile networks, handover is one of the main features that allow user's
 mobility 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 The concept behind the handover operation is simple: when a user moves
 from the coverage area of a cell (e.g.
 cell 1) to the coverage area of a neighboring cell (e.g.
 cell 2), the system creates a new connection with cell 2 and disconnects
 the user from cell 1 while keeping the current connection active.
 For the correct operation of the handover procedure, the layout of the
 mobile network should ensure some coverage overlapping at the border areas
 of neighboring cells.
 Without coverage overlapping, the system would not be able to maintain
 an active connection during the passage from the coverage of one cell to
 the coverage of the neighboring one.
 Figure

 shows the overlapping between Cell 1 and Cell 2.
 The distribution of these areas "of multiple coverage" is always centered
 around the border

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This border is defined by the relationship between pilot power and interference
 among neighboring cells.
 It is important to notice that this is not a geographical border and it
 is constantly changing, since the range of radio signals is affected by
 many external factors (weather, network traffic, terrain and many more).

\begin_layout Standard
In UMTS, transmissions are categorized regarding the direction of the connection
; there are two different types: downlink (i.e.
 from the network towards the mobile terminal) and uplink (i.e.
 from the mobile terminal towards the network).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Every mobile terminal constantly monitors the downlink pilot power channel
 (CPICH) of the connected cell and its neighbors.
 The information about these measurements is sent to the network in the
 uplink direction.
 When the CPICH of the connected cell is lower than a specified threshold,
 the network sends a command to the mobile terminal to handover to the best

 measured neighboring cell.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because handover involves control messages being sent to and from the network,
 cell coverage overlap must exist for connections in both directions: downlink
 and uplink.
 If the downlink and uplink coverage areas do not match, handover suffers
 from different kinds of malfunctioning 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "WCDMAforUMTS_RadioAccessForThirdGenerationMobileCommunications"

\end_inset

.
 Many UMTS networks exhibit differences in the downlink and uplink coverage
 areas, hence around the border of neighboring cells.
 One reason for this incorrect alignment is the diversity of hardware installed
 at the base stations.
 Different kinds of amplifiers, cables and antennas create power lags and/or
 gains in a certain direction.

\begin_layout Standard
Downlink cell coverage is controlled by the CPICH power level of the cell
 and its configuration may be changed through software.
 On the other hand, uplink coverage is defined by the hardware installed
 at the base station and cannot be regulated with a control parameter.
 Take, for example, Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:softHandoverUnaligned"

\end_inset

, which shows a simplified case of power gap between two cells.
 Coverage of Cell 2 is broader in the uplink, and the gap it has created
 with its neighbor, Cell 1, is marked.
 A trivial solution to this problem would be to decrease the CPICH power
 of Cell 1, so that the downlink cell border would match the uplink cell
 border, and, at the same time, ensure enough coverage overlap.

\begin_layout Standard
When working with real UMTS networks, there are no trivial solutions.
 A typical UMTS network has thousands of cells, each of them being able
 to recognize tens of neighboring cells.
 In such cases, the challenge is to find such a combination of CPICH power
 levels that minimizes the difference between downlink and uplink powers
 among neighboring cells, while ensuring enough coverage overlap to enable
 flawless handover procedures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Candidate solutions and their constraints
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given an operating UMTS network that suffers from the consequences of non-alignm
ent of handover areas, we concentrate on the minimization of the difference
 between downlink and uplink powers.
 To achieve this, the algorithm should examine CPICH power levels for all
 the cells in the network, such that any newly proposed CPICH value doesn't
 differ from the initial one by more than 2 dB, i.e.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size small
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
-2dB<CPICH_{initial}-CPICH_{proposed}<2dB\label{eq:solution_constraint}\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, if a cell has an initial CPICH power of 30 dBm, then the candidate
 solutions for this cell would fall in the interval (28 dBm, 32 dBm).
 The objective of this hard-coded limit is to come up with a solution to
 the balancing problem that doesn't affect the initial coverage of the mobile
 network.
 Therefore, the coverage overlap between neighboring cells is also kept,
 so that handovers are operative after a newly found solution has been applied
 to the network.
 Larger intervals would potentially help the algorithm to find better solutions
 to the balancing problem, but at the cost of potentially altering network
 coverage.

Optimization objective 
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 denote the set of cells in a UMTS network and let 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 denote a finite undirected graph.
 We denote the set of vertices in 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

, representing the cells in 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

.
 It follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $|V|=|C|$
\end_inset

.
 An edge connecting two vertices 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{1},v_{2}\in V$
\end_inset

 shows that cells 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1},c_{2}\in C$
\end_inset

 are neighbors.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 denote the adjacency matrix of 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

.
 Consequently, 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 is the 
\begin_inset Formula $|V|\times|V|$
\end_inset

 matrix where the non-diagonal entry 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{ij}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $1\le i,j\le|V|$
\end_inset

, is 1 if and only if there is an edge connecting vertices 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

.
 All diagonal entries 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{ii}$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 are 0 since no vertex has an edge to itself (i.e.
 no cell is neighbor of itself).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By considering the hardware installed on the base station and the CPICH
 power level of a cell, 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{i}\in C$
\end_inset

, we may calculate the uplink and downlink powers for each cell in the UMTS
 network.
 Hence we define the objective of this optimization problem as the minimization
 of the difference between downlink and uplink powers, i.e.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\min\sum_{i=1}^{|V|}\sum_{j=i}^{|V|}|a_{ij}d_{ij}|,\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{ij}$
\end_inset

 is the entry in 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 at row 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 and column 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{ij}$
\end_inset

 is the power difference between cells 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 Considering that 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 is a symmetric matrix, we take into account only the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

upper half
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 not to calculate the power difference between two cells more than once.
 We are also assuming that the radio propagation conditions between neighboring
 cells are similar enough for them to be neglected, and thus excluded from
 the objective function evaluation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The definition of 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{ij}$
\end_inset

 is as follows
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size small
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
d_{ij}=\frac{\left(DL(c_{i})-DL(c_{j})\right)+\left(UL(c_{i})-UL(c_{j})\right)}{-2},\label{eq:power_difference}\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $DL(c_{i})$
\end_inset

 is the downlink power of cell 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{i}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $UL(c_{j})$
\end_inset

 is the uplink power of cell 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $d=0$
\end_inset

, the CPICH power level needs no correction, either because there is no
 difference between the downlink and uplink powers of 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{j}$
\end_inset

, or because 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{j}$
\end_inset

 aren't neighbors (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{ij}=0$
\end_inset

).
 A different value of 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{ij}$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{ij}<0$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{ij}>0$
\end_inset

) represents the CPICH power adjustment of cell 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{i}$
\end_inset

 that is required to balance both power levels.

 Such a wide spectrum of proposed procedures is directly related to the
 diverse criteria taken into account when assigning the CPICH power of a
 cell.
 The fundamental reason behind this fact is that the CPICH transmit power
 is a common factor of various optimization problems in UMTS networks.

At each time step during the process, the system under optimization is in
 a given 
\emph on
state
\emph default
.
 The objective function maps a system state to a value known as the 
\emph on
energy
\emph default
 of the system in that state.
 A 
\emph on
move
\emph default
 in the search space represents a change in the state of the system.
 After making a move, the system may exhibit lower or higher energy, depending
 on the results of the objective function.
 When dealing with minimization problems, a better state always describes
 lower energy than the previous one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Simulated annealing incorporates the notion of 
\emph on
temperature
\emph default
, by which the probability of moving the current state of the system into
 a worst one is lowered as the temperature decreases during the optimization
 process.
 Exploration of the search space is thus induced at higher temperature,

 moves are accepted.

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $Net_{2}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $Net_{3}$

 represents a network deployed over a mostly rural area, where the network
 configuration emphasizes coverage over user capacity, since the resident

 configuration elements.
 The last network,

\end_inset

, is deployed over a highly populated urban area, thus it presents a strict
 urban configuration profile.
 The three selected networks exhibit different operation and configuration
 schemes, depending on the dominant user's profile of each area.
 For this reason, the observed handover and soft-handover

 behavior is fairly different among these scenarios, enabling the mobile
 operator to measure the impact of the optimization results given the particular
 conditions of each sub-network.
 Moreover, by challenging our optimization approach with problem instances
 of different characteristics and sizes, we are confident to gain better
 understanding about the optimization process itself.

Based on the number of cells and neighbor relations in each network, we
 have set the initial temperature and the number of iterations for simulated
 annealing.
 For the initial temperature, we have used half the number of neighbor relations
, whereas the number of iterations is a thousand times the number of cells.
 The parameters used for each test network are shown in Table

 In all three cases, we have used the exponential schema for lowering the

Experimental environment

\begin_layout Standard
All experiments were done on a 4-core Intel i7 2.67 GHz desktop computer
 with 6 GB of RAM running a 64-bit Linux operating system.
 The implementation language used was Python, with certain parts of the
 objective function evaluation implemented in C, which improved the overall
 performance of the optimization process.

Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 presents the best results obtained after 20 independent runs.
 We may observe that our optimization approach improved the objective significan
tly in all three problem instances.
 Results show that we have reduced the number of non-aligned neighbor relations,
 without changing the CPICH setting of any single cell for more than 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm$
\end_inset

2 dB, as it is defined by (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:solution_constraint"

\end_inset

).
 These results also indicate that the complexity of the problem quickly
 raises with the number of cells and neighbor relations in the network,
 since the achieved improvement is smaller for bigger networks.
 However, all tested problem instances are complex enough to make it very
 difficult and time consuming for an engineer to optimize them by hand.

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have presented an optimization approach to tackle the problem of non-alignmen
t of handover areas in UMTS.
 The results presented confirm that our method, based on simulated annealing,
 is capable of improving the network by correcting many of the non-aligned
 relations present before the optimization.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the key advantages of the presented optimization method is that there
 is no need for parameter tuning to improve a given network configuration.
 This follows from the definitions given in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Test-networks"

\end_inset

 for parameter setting, with which we have improved all three problem instances.

Future work shall include an in-depth analysis of the results presented
 regarding network performance.
 Nevertheless, the a priori assumption is that the optimized network configurati
ons should help avoiding much of the malfunctioning observed during handover
 and soft-handover procedures in UMTS, since the number of non-aligned handover
 areas has been greatly reduced.
